Electric Vehicles Data Analysis | Tableau

Designed and developed a dynamic Tableau dashboard to analyze electric vehicle (EV) data from over 150,000 records across the United States.

Visualized EV distribution by state, model year, and vehicle make to uncover trends in EV adoption, showing a significant rise in 2023 with 37K+ registrations.

Assessed average electric range (67.83 miles) and vehicle type composition, with 77.62% BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) and 22.38% PHEVs (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles).

Conducted comparative analysis on EV models and makes, highlighting Tesla as the market leader (52.7%) followed by Nissan and Chevrolet.

Implemented donut charts to evaluate Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility, identifying that over 41% of EVs were eligible.

Created interactive filters for model, state, CAFV eligibility, and vehicle type to support deeper, user-driven insights.
